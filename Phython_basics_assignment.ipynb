        "\n",
        "    Python is popular for several reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "a. It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects and faster to improve on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.\n",

        "\n",
        "f. Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. The vast support community means that when coders need help, finding a solution is relatively easy; somebody has likely encountered the same problem before\n"
